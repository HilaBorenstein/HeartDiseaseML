containing the files

1. a.  File name- 
		FeatureSelection.py

	b.Description:
		The file is uses by the Main program and its purpose is to remove irrelevant features per:
		•	identify_missing
			find features with a fraction of missing values above a specified threshold.
		•	identify_single_unique
			find any columns that have a single unique value..
		•	identify_collinear
			Collinear features are features that are highly correlated with one another.


2. a. Files names- 
		KNeighbors.py
		SVM.py
		mergingFilesTest3.py
		DecisionTree.py
		RandomForest.py
		AdaBoost.py
		GBoost.py
		XGBoost.py
		Voting.py

	b.description:
		These file is uses by the Main program and containig the code for each alogrithm.
		More explanations about the code can be found under etc/hila project.docx 

3. a. Files names- 
		Main.py

	b.description:
		The Main program which you can run each model from it .
		The parameters for each model already set per investigation i made for finding the best parameters which contribute the model performance subject to time and memory constrains.
		Full investigation can be found under etc/hila project.docx

3. In order to run model and hypothesis please run the command:

	python src/Main.py --Model <a> --Test_size <b>

	where:

	<a> is Model name can be one of the following: KNN, SVM, DT, RF,
	            Bagging, AdaBoost, GBoost, XGBoost, Voting.
	<b> is test size , can be choose between 0.1 to 0.3

	For more inforamtion type command :python src/Main.py -h



Possible future assignments for the project:
 - Deep learning / unsupervised learning mechanisms
 - Sequenced + recurrent networks
